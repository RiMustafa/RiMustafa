## Hello :wave:

I'm a freelance web developer and recent college gradute with a degree in Computer Science! I am passionate about bringing a modern look and improved performance to the web through the use of frameworks like React and Vue. 

Although my professional focus has tailored toward the web, during my degree I accrued skills that allow me to create applications with a multitude of technologies and languages. Most recently I have been developing games with python and building fullstack applications with relational based databases (specifically PostGres). 

I look forward to developing a deep relationship with my fellow linkedin connections!
